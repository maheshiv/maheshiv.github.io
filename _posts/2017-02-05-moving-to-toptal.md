I am always interested in working as a freelancer. Getting good opportunities as a freelancer is difficult but once we get, we will be in a better position to manage.  
I have researched on many sites about freelancing in that I picked [Toptal][toptal]. I have read comments and blogs related to Toptal, it looks very promising to me.  
Currently, I am working in Bangalore, India. My home location is 6 km from my office. Getting ready & traveling will take 2-3 hours/day. After coming from heavy traffic, we feel like we are tired. To get rid of this problems, it is better for us to do work as a freelancer.  
Toptal has very good companies on their list if we have the good technical background, they will hire us.
I have read about the interview process in [Toptal][interview].  
1. They conduct screening test to check our English language understanding/writing skills.  
2. Online coding test to check our problem solving skills.  
3. Live coding skill test by Toptal developers.  
4. Do project in two weeks.
